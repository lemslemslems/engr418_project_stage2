    "## Problem Description\n",
    "This is a continuation of the previous stage of the project, where we were tasked to design a multi-class classifier in classifying 4 different Legos. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, instead of having all the Legos centered and oriented in a certain way, this time the data to be fed contains Legos with all kinds of positioning and orientation, which adds another degree to the difficulty. We are also requireed to use only 64 features (8x8 pixels per image), instead of 4096 features (64x64 pixels per image) as in stage 1. This implies the use of feature engineering and selection, as well as possibly dimension reduction before applying the regressor.  "
